Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once.

This is a **fork** of the Prism Launcher and is not endorsed by Prism.
### Development Builds

There are development builds available [here](https://github.com/Pegoku/PrismLauncher-cracked/actions). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.

Prebuilt Development builds are provided for **Linux**, **Windows** and **macOS**.

## License

All launcher code is available under the GPL-3.0-only license.
